{: .sentences}
| **Ruqshua da.**  [①](#fn-1)[②](#fn-2) | It's raining.          |
| **Kéo choa da.** [③](#fn-3)           | But there is talking.  |
| **Rú hıaı da.**  [③](#fn-4)           | And there is laughing. |
| **De cháq da.**  [④](#fn-5)[⑤](#fn-6) | It's a beautiful day.  |

## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> **ruqshua** means "to rain". It carries a falling tone ![](../tones/d1.png), indicated by the absence of a tone mark.

2. <a name="fn-2" /> **da**, in the falling tone, marks a sentence as an assertion. It is always found at the end of a sentence. There are also other equivalent particles for questions and imperatives, which we will come across in future lessons.

3. <a name="fn-3" /> **choa** is another verb ("to utter a sound"). Again, it can be identified as such because it carries a falling tone ![](../tones/d1.png). The word **kéo** ("but"), a conjunction, is in the rising tone, indicated by the acute accent on the **é**.

4. <a name="fn-4" /> The word **rú** ("and"), another conjunction, is again in the rising tone.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> This sentence literally means "The day is beautiful". The verb is **de** "to be beautiful". In Toaq, the verb comes first in a sentence, and is followed by the nouns.

6. <a name="fn-6" /> **cháq** means "the day". It carries a rising tone ![](../tones/d2.png). We will learn more about using this tone to make nouns in the next lesson.
