## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> **rủqshūa** means "to rain". The first syllable **ruq** carries a falling tone ![](../tones/t4.png), which shows that this word is a verb.

2. <a name="fn-2" /> **da** marks a sentence as an assertion. It is always found at the end of a sentence. There are also other equivalent particles for questions and imperatives, which we will come across in future lessons. You may have noticed that **da** does not carry a tone mark. In **Toaq**, most function words are toneless. This means that their meaning does not change from an alteration in pitch, making these words very easy.

3. <a name="fn-3" /> **chỏa** is another verb ("to utter a sound"). Again, it can be identified as such because it carries a falling tone ![](../tones/t4.png).

4. <a name="fn-4" /> This sentence literally means "The day is beautiful". The verb is **dẻ** "to be beautiful". In **Toaq**, the verb comes first in a sentence, and is followed by the nouns.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> **cháq** means "the day". It carries a rising tone ![](../tones/t2.png). We will learn more about this tone in the next lesson.
