## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> **kune** "dog" is a root word with more than one syllable. We met another such root in Lesson 4. An interesting point worth appreciating here again is that the words for "dog" and "apple" are verbs in Toaq. **kune** means "to be a dog", **shamu** "to be an apple". The noun meanings are derived from these verbs, either via a rising tone ![](../tones/d2.png) (**kúne** "the dog(s)", **shamu** "the apple(s)") or via **sá** (**sá kune** "some dog(s)", **sá shamu** "some apple(s)") or **tú** (**tú kune** "every dog", **tú shamu** "every apple").

2. <a name="fn-2" /> **hóı** is a so-called *vocative marker*. It is placed in front of a noun and indicates that the noun is the party being addressed by the speaker. Here, it is mother (**máma**) who is being addressed.

3. <a name="fn-3" /> The particle **bï** is a topic marker. It's preceded by a noun in the rising tone, and establishes that noun as the topic of the sentence. In English, this is sometimes expressed via phrases like "As for the dog, ...", or "About the dog, ...". The topic should be *definite*: that is, it should have ![the rising tone](../tones/d2.png) on it instead of **sá** or **tú** before it. If you want to move a **sá** or **tú** noun to the front of the sentence, use **nä** as we saw in Lesson 5.

4. <a name="fn-4" /> **hí X** can generally be translated as "which X" or "what X". Grammatically, it works just like **sá** and **tú**. **hí kua** "which (thing that is a) room", **hí kune** "which dog". In the previous lesson, **hí raı** was given as simply "what". This is because the verb **raı** means "to be something", so **hí raı** means "which something", which really just amounts to "what".

5. <a name="fn-5" /> **nuokua** "bedroom" is a compound whose components are **nuo** "sleep" and **kua** "room". You should have no problem remembering that it means "bedroom", since that’s the room which is mainly used for sleeping.

6. <a name="fn-6" /> **bu** "not" is placed right before the verb.

7. <a name="fn-7" /> **ba** is what turns this sentence into a command.

8. <a name="fn-8" /> **úmo** is another pronoun. It means "we", but specifically refers to the speaker and the listener, as opposed to the speaker and some third party.
