## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> **Sỏaq da** "There is a garden". We saw sentences of this form in Lesson 1. When a verb is used without any nouns, it describes a situation where something is or does the thing described by the verb, without saying what thing in particular. Recall **Hỉaı da** "There is laughing" from Lesson 1. Another example: **Kỉa da** "There is red."

2. <a name="fn-2" /> **sa pỏq** "a person", "somebody", "some people".  **sa** before a verb makes an indefinite noun. We already encountered **sa shỉ** "someone"/"something" in the previous lesson. Compare this to **póq**, which would mean "the person" or "the people".

3. <a name="fn-3" /> In this lesson, we are taking a closer look at compounds.  **kủeqtūa** "to gather/collect something" and **shảmū** "to be an apple" (**shámū** "the apple(s)") are examples of such compounds. Compounds are verbs that are made up of two or more syllables. The even tone ![](../tones/t1.png) is used to glue the syllables together -- if you hear or read a syllable that carries the even tone ![](../tones/t1.png), it always means that it is part of the same word as the previous syllable. Note that the first syllable of a word *never* carries the even tone ![](../tones/t1.png). Instead, the first syllable of a word carries the tone that determines which part of speech the word belongs to, i.e., whether it is a verb, a noun, or something else (we will learn about several others in the remainder of this course).

4. <a name="fn-4" /> **hó** "he/she/they" is another pronoun. It refers to one or more people and is gender-neutral.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> Note how in English, we say "I arrive at/in the garden", but **tỉshā jí sóaq** literally means "arrive I garden". It is not necessary to use "at" or "in". Whichever noun comes second is automatically understood to be the place of arrival.

6. <a name="fn-6" /> The function words **mó** and **teo** are placed around quoted text. Think of them as spoken quotation marks.

7. <a name="fn-7" /> With **ba**, we encounter our first partner of **da**. In Lesson 1 it was hinted at the fact that there are other particles like **da** for questions and imperatives -- **ba** is used in expressing various kinds of imperatives. By placing **ba** at the end of a sentence (in place of **da**), the sentence is transformed into an imperative. An imperative with **ba** can be used to express requests and commands, but also invitations, permissions, exhortations and more.

8. <a name="fn-8" /> **tıu** "then, in that case" belongs to the same class as **keo** "but". These words are known as *sentence prefixes*, because they are prefixed to a sentence. As such, they also function as unambiguous sentence breaks.

9. <a name="fn-9" /> **je** is another sentence prefix. Unlike **keo** and **tıu**, this one does not carry any additional meaning beyond marking the beginning of a new sentence. It is commonly used to mark breaks in speech or in text, like the beginning of a new paragraph or a new topic.

10. <a name="fn-10" /> **tu pỏq** "everyone", "everybody", "each person". For now, remember this as a unit.
