## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> **Sỏaq da** "There is a garden". We saw sentences of this form in Lesson 1. When a verb is used without any nouns, it describes a situation where something is or does the thing described by the verb, without saying what thing in particular. Recall **Hỉaı da** "There is laughing" from Lesson 1. Another example: **Kỉa da** "There is red."

2. <a name="fn-2" /> **sa pỏq** "a person", "somebody", "some people".  **sa** before a verb makes an indefinite noun. We already encountered **sa shỉ** "someone"/"something" in the previous lesson. Compare this to **póq**, which would mean "the person" or "the people".

3. <a name="fn-3" /> Let's take a closer look at compounds and tone.  **kủeqtua** "to gather/collect something" and **shảmu** "to be an apple" (**shámu** "the apple(s)") are examples of compounds: verbs that are made up of two or more syllables. The tone marked on the first vowel is spread out over the entire word.

  In writing, spaces helpfully mark where words start and end. When speaking, we always "break" the previous tone contour to mark the start of a new word. This means that **shámu da** is pronounced with a small drop on the **da**, to distinguish it from a would-be three-syllable compound **shámuda**. Similarly, **kủeqtua da** is pronounced with the **da** a little higher, to distinguish it from **kủeqtuada**.

4. <a name="fn-4" /> **hó** "he/she/they" is another pronoun. It refers to one or more people and is gender-neutral.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> Note how in English, we say "I arrive at/in the garden", but **tỉsha jí sóaq** literally means "arrive I garden". It is not necessary to use "at" or "in". Whichever noun comes second is automatically understood to be the place of arrival.

6. <a name="fn-6" /> The function words **mó** and **teo** are placed around quoted text. Think of them as spoken quotation marks.

7. <a name="fn-7" /> With **ba**, we encounter our first partner of **da**. In Lesson 1 it was hinted at the fact that there are other particles like **da** for questions and imperatives -- **ba** is used in expressing various kinds of imperatives. By placing **ba** at the end of a sentence (in place of **da**), the sentence is transformed into an imperative. An imperative with **ba** can be used to express requests and commands, but also invitations, permissions, exhortations and more.

8. <a name="fn-8" /> **tıu** "then, in that case" belongs to the same class as **keo** "but". These words are known as *sentence prefixes*, because they are prefixed to a sentence. As such, they also function as unambiguous sentence breaks.

9. <a name="fn-9" /> **je** is another sentence prefix. Unlike **keo** and **tıu**, this one does not carry any additional meaning beyond marking the beginning of a new sentence. It is commonly used to mark breaks in speech or in text, like the beginning of a new paragraph or a new topic.

10. <a name="fn-10" /> **tu pỏq** "everyone", "everybody", "each person". For now, remember this as a unit.
