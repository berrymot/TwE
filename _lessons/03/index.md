## Notes

1. <a name="fn-1" /> In the last lesson we learned that there are many verbs in **Toaq** that would be nouns in English. **kủa** "to be a room" is another such word. Actually, the truth is that *every* word in **Toaq** is a verb (unless it is a function word, such as **da** or **ru**). We will see a more technical explanation of this in Lesson 7.

2. <a name="fn-2" /> **tỉ** means "to be at a place", "to be present at" and can be used any time two things exhibit spatial overlap.  **nỉe** "to be inside something" would be more specific.

3. <a name="fn-3" /> Now we see **kua** again, but this time with a rising tone ![](../tones/t2.png). While **kủa** means "to be a room", **kúa** means "the room(s)" (singular or plural not specified). The transformation from the verb meaning to the noun meaning follows a regular pattern: When applying a rising tone ![](../tones/t2.png) to a verb, the resulting expression refers to things that are or do the thing described by the verb. The meaning of **kủa** is "to be a room", so **kúa** must refer to something which "is a room" -- ergo, a room or rooms.

4. <a name="fn-4" /> For now, remember **sa shỉ** "one", "someone", "something" as is.

5. <a name="fn-5" /> **sủq** is the base form of the pronoun **súq** ("you") we encountered in line 2. Maybe you already guessed its meaning: "to be you". Yes, even the pronouns are verbs in **Toaq**. By applying the rising tone ![](../tones/t2.png) to the verb **sủq**, we get a noun that refers to something which is or does the thing described by the verb, here something which "is you", i.e., "you". The same goes for the noun **núo**, which refers to "someone who sleeps".

6. <a name="fn-6" /> By now you can probably guess that **jỉ** has to mean "to be me".

7. <a name="fn-7" /> **níjūı** "this (thing) here", "these (things) here" and **níjāo** "that (thing) there", "those (things) there" are more precise forms of **ní** "this/that", which you are already familiar with. Note that these words can be used with objects and people alike, without being impolite.

8. <a name="fn-8" /> And one more time, **báo** with a rising tone ![](../tones/t2.png) refers to something which is or does the thing described by the verb "to be white", therefore it refers to something which is white -- it means "the white thing(s)". And analogously: **kía** "the red thing(s)".
