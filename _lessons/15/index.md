# **Chíetoaı namako** -- Bonus lesson

Toaq with Ease was supposed to have 50 lessons, but only 14 have been written by the author. In anticipation of the community writing more lessons, or entirely new learning materials, this dialogue-free lesson will serve as a small overview of new but essential Toaq features not covered in the previous lessons.

## Sentence structure

You can actually leave **da** or **móq** off the end of a sentence. If there are question words, the meaning is as if you said **móq**, and otherwise it's as if you said **da**.

In addition, you can prepend **ꝡa** (in the falling tone) to a declarative sentence or **hí**-question without changing its meaning.

These sentences all mean the same thing:

- **Aojaı súq hí raı móq?**
- **Aojaı súq hí raı?**
- **Ꝡa aojaı súq hí raı móq?**
- **Ꝡa aojaı súq hí raı?**

## Events

Toaq makes a distinction between propositions (statements which are merely true or false in some context) and events ("instances" of some fact being true in a world, at a particular place and time).

A sentence like **Joaı déo kúne** claims the existence of some "seeking-event", in which the child and the dog are participants. Toaq lets us refer to the underlying fact using **ꝡä**, as you have learned. But there is another word, **ë**, for referring to an event:

> **ë joaı déo kúne**
> "(to be) an event of the child seeking the dog"

Just like a verb, we can either change its tone to the rising tone ![](../tones/d2.png) to make a noun...

> **Kaqsı jí é joaı déo kúne.**
> I look at **the** event(s) of the child seeking the dog.

or we can put a determiner like **sá** in front.

> **Kaqsı jí sá ë joaı déo kúne.**
> I look at **some** event(s) of the child seeking the dog.

These sentences are more correct than **Kaqsı jí ꝡä…** in that we can't really "look at" a fact, but we can look at an event, which inhabits space and time.

## Pronouns

The word **hó** is actually specifically an "anaphoric" pronoun: it refers to an animate party mentioned earlier in the text. We didn't learn the more generic third-person personal pronouns: **nháo** (he/she/they, singular) and **nhána** (they, plural).

## What's left?

Toaq's grammar is not very big, and this course has covered most of the essentials. We didn't learn about certain common constructs, like adjectives, adverbs, or serial verbs. The wiki has an [overview of the grammar](https://toaq.me/Grammar_overview) that touches on these concepts. They are described in full in the [reference grammar](https://toaq.net/refgram/).

You can round out your vocabulary by reading the [cheat sheet](https://toaq.me/Cheat_sheet) or browsing [Toadua](https://toaq.me/Toadua). Or you can come talk to us on [Discord](https://toaq.me/Discord). If you made it this far, I'm sure you can form more sentences than you think! **Laojaı íme, ꝡä choaqfa súq íme da.** ![Toaq-heart](../tones/toaqhua.png){: height="20" }
